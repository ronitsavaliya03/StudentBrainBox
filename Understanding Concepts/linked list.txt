struct Node* first = NULL;
struct Node* ptr1 = first; // ptr1 = NULL

while (ptr1->link != NULL) // ptr1 is NULL -- Crash!

Why we always include ptr1 != NULL:
To protect the program from crashing if the list is empty, or ptr1 becomes NULL in some case.
It exits unexpectedly without completing its task.

In C programming, this is usually caused by invalid memory access.

When does a crash happen?
Here are the most common reasons:

Situation					                          Example				                Result
❌ Accessing memory through a NULL pointer	ptr->data when ptr == NULL	  Crash
❌ Accessing array out of bounds		        arr[10] when array size is 5	Crash or garbage value
❌ Freeing already freed memory			        free(ptr); free(ptr);		      Crash
❌ Using uninitialized pointer			        struct Node *p; p->data = 5;	Crash
